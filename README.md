Overview

This project focuses on predicting multiple diseases such as Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Parkinsonâ€™s Disease using Machine Learning algorithms. The main goal is to provide a fast, accessible, and accurate diagnostic tool that can assist healthcare professionals and public health authorities in identifying diseases early and monitoring at-risk populations.

The application features a user-friendly interface that allows patients or healthcare providers to input relevant medical data, and the system will provide an immediate prediction based on the trained machine learning models.
