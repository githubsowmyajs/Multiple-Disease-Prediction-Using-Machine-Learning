# Multiple Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting multiple diseases such as Heart Disease, Diabetes, and Parkinson’s Disease using Machine Learning algorithms. The main goal is to provide a fast, accessible, and accurate diagnostic tool that can assist healthcare professionals and public health authorities in identifying diseases early and monitoring at-risk populations.
The application features a user-friendly interface that allows patients or healthcare providers to input relevant medical data, and the system will provide an immediate prediction based on the trained machine learning models.

# Motivation
Early disease detection is crucial for effective treatment and better healthcare outcomes. Unfortunately, healthcare resources, especially in rural or underdeveloped areas, are limited, making timely diagnoses challenging. This project aims to mitigate that challenge by providing a low-cost, AI-powered tool that can be used to assess the likelihood of multiple diseases using readily available medical data.
The system also aims to assist healthcare workers in monitoring larger populations and providing data-driven insights that can help predict and prevent disease outbreaks. By democratizing access to disease prediction technology, this system could reduce the global burden of preventable diseases.

# Features
1.Multiple Disease Prediction:
-->Heart Disease
-->Diabetes
-->Parkinson's Disease
2.Real-time Diagnostics: Predict disease likelihood based on inputted medical data instantly.
3.Customizable Inputs: Users can input patient data via CSV or manually.
4.AI-Powered Risk Assessment: Uses cutting-edge machine learning algorithms like SVM, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks for high accuracy.
5.Visualization: Presents data insights, feature importance, and prediction probabilities in a clear and intuitive manner.

# Usage
1.Launch the Application: Open the Streamlit application by accessing localhost:8501 on your browser after running the app.

2.Select Disease for Prediction: Choose one of the three diseases (Heart, Diabetes, Parkinson's) for prediction.

3.Upload Medical Data: Upload a CSV file with patient medical data or manually input the values.

4.View Prediction: The app will instantly show the predicted disease outcome along with a probability score and a feature-importance visualization.
